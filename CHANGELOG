0.1 Initial implementation
0.2 Fixed Batch img2img implementation
0.3 Added interval implementation for combinations, i.e. you can now use {1-2$$op1|opt2|opt3} which will choose one or two options. Thanks to @galvanized for this.
0.4 Rows in a wildcard file that contain dynamic syntax will be resolved. This enables recusive resolution. See [this](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting/issues/3) feature request for a use case
0.4.1 Fixed regular expression for wildcards, it previously didn't allow wildcard files with underscores in them.
0.4.2 Ignoring unknown characters in non-utf8 encoding wildcard files
0.4.3 Printing prompts at logger level INFO
0.4.4 Fixed bug where num_batches was being interpreted as num_images
0.4.5 Enabled generation of grids
0.5.0 The script can now handle nested wildcard directories in order to make it easier to organise large wildcard collections. Comments and empty lines are now ignored. Both features thanks to @evanjs 
0.6.0 Added path globbing for wildcards. Thanks for @evanjs for the idea and original implementation
0.7.0 Updated wildcard ui by @TheAwesomeGoat.7.0 Updated wildcard ui by @TheAwesomeGoat
0.8.0 Combinatorial generation 
0.9.0 Started a modifer library. Turns out it's much better than the long unsorted lists of artists you find elsewhere.
0.9.1 Added local Random instance to ensure repeatability without changing the global random number generator
0.9.2 Added additional artists and refactored code.
0.10.0 Added magic prompts
0.11.0 Migrated to an extension
0.12.0 Added a slider to enable combinatorial generation in batches, in other words, run the same set of prompts with different seeds
0.13.0 Added same seed checkbox to keep the seed constant for all generations.
0.13.1 Fixed light mode css
0.13.2 Fixed combinatorial bug which generated duplicate templates
0.13.3 Added an option to revert 0.9.1. There isn't a ui for it yet, but you can edit constants.py. Change to UNLINK_SEED_FROM_PROMPT = True
0.13.4 Fixed 0.13.3, but thiss time for real
0.13.5 Updated stylesheet from @Yaiol to fix light and dark theme
